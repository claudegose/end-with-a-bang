                While hope seems right around the corner, it seems like we’re still going to be staying indoors for the next few months. While we might occasionally be able to have a (socially distanced) outing, we’re continuing to mostly rely on grocery delivery and lots of pizza deliveries, and it’s safe to say we’re all a bit weary of seeing the four walls of our homes all the time. Thanks to these virtual tours, though, you won’t have to leave the comfort of your bed to visit the exhibition, enjoy the Louvre or experience the wonders of the galaxy at NASA firsthand.

                These are all the best virtual tours to take during your downtime. The only question is: Which one should we take first?
